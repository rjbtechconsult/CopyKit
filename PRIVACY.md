# Privacy Policy for CopyKit

_Last updated: 14th July 2025_

## Overview

**CopyKit** is a Chrome Extension designed to help developers extract and copy HTML blocks, styles, scripts, or full pages directly from websites. This tool operates entirely on your local machine and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

---

## What Data We Collect

**None.**

CopyKit does **not** collect, transmit, or store any of the following:
- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Cookies or session data
- Site content or user input
- Analytics or usage metrics

---

## How CopyKit Works

CopyKit operates entirely within your browser, using content scripts to:
- Read visible HTML and CSS on the current page
- Copy selected elements or content to your clipboard upon your action

All processing and copying happens **locally on your device**. No data is sent to any server.

---

## Permissions

The extension requests the following Chrome permissions:
- `activeTab` â€” to interact with the page you're viewing
- `scripting` â€” to inject content scripts that enable block selection
- `clipboardWrite` â€” to copy selected content to your clipboard
- `storage` â€” used internally to store user preferences (if enabled)

These permissions are used strictly for the extensionâ€™s functionality. CopyKit does not use them to track or analyze your behavior.

---

## Third-Party Services

CopyKit does **not** use or integrate with any third-party analytics, ad services, or external APIs.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect improvements or required compliance changes. All changes will be posted on the [Chrome Web Store listing](https://chromewebstore.google.com) and in this file.
